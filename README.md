Intern Evaluation Task: Mini AI App Builder Portal + User App UI

## Quick start

- Prereqs: Install Node.js LTS and npm.
- Server:
  - In a terminal: `cd server`
  - Install: `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
  - Env file: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values
  - Run: `npm run dev`
- Client:
  - In a second terminal: `cd client`
  - Install: `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
  - Run: `npm run dev`
- Conncurrently Running Both:

  - In a terminal: `cd` to the repo root
  - Install: `npm ci` (or `npm install`)
  - Run: `npm run dev`
  - This uses `concurrently` to run both the server and client in one terminal window, with tags and colors to differentiate the output.
